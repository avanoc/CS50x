# CS50
Hi! 
I'll be storing here, all of the codes I had to write to pass both CS50x and CS50p course.
It's been a long way since the first "Hello World" and know there's still a long road ahead of me.
I highly recommend this experience to anyone who's starting or wants to improve in these skills.
Both courses are free and you can find them at edx.org
Best of luck!
